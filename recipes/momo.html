            <ol>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the flour with water and knead until smooth to form dough. Cover and rest for 30 minutes.</li>

                <li>Place a spoonful of filling in the center of each circle.</li>
                <li>Fold and pleat the edges to seal the momo (use any folding style you like).</li>
                <li>Arrange momos in a steamer tray, making sure they don’t touch.</li>
                <li>Steam over boiling water for 8–10 minutes until the wrappers turn slightly translucent and the filling is cooked.</li>
                <li>Serve hot with tomato achar or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
